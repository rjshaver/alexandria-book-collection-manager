# Taken from a tip on the ruby-gnome2 website

# First, force all your your Ruby threads to start from within the
# main loop using the standard Gtk.init method. You can call Gtk.init
# as many times as necessary. For example:
#
# Gtk.init_add do
#   DBus.start_listener
#   false
# end

require 'monitor'

module Gtk
  GTK_PENDING_BLOCKS = []
  GTK_PENDING_BLOCKS_LOCK = Monitor.new

  def self.queue(&block)
    if Thread.current == Thread.main
      block.call
    else
      GTK_PENDING_BLOCKS_LOCK.synchronize do
        GTK_PENDING_BLOCKS << block
      end
    end
  end

  # an optional addition from http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/125038
  # "I call Gtk.thread_flush right after killing a thread when I ever
  # happen to need kill a thread" -- Mathieu Blondel

  #     def self.thread_flush
  #         if PENDING_CALLS_MUTEX.try_lock
  #             for closure in PENDING_CALLS
  #                 closure.call
  #             end
  #             PENDING_CALLS.clear
  #             PENDING_CALLS_MUTEX.unlock
  #         end
  #     end

  def self.main_with_queue(timeout = 100) # millis
    GLib.timeout_add(GLib::PRIORITY_DEFAULT, timeout, proc do
      GTK_PENDING_BLOCKS_LOCK.synchronize do

# Usage is very simple:

# Start your Gtk application by calling Gtk.main_with_queue rather
# than Gtk.main. The "timeout" argument is in milliseconds, and it is
# the maximum time that can pass until queued blocks get called: 100
# should be fine.

# Whenever you need to queue a call, use Gtk.queue. For example:
